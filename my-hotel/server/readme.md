# Code Your Future DB Module Exercises

## Introduction

This exercise involves implementing various aspects of a hotel booking system. It involves a variety of operations on the database to fetch, insert and update data.

The tasks build on your previous experience using SQL with SQLite and Node.js. The key components of the application are as follows:

* `index.js` - sets up the application for use
* `server/class2.js` - router for simple application logic and interaction with the database;
* `server/class3.js` - routes for advanced application logic and interaction with the database;

In order to interact with the server we will be using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to perform the HTTP requests.

## Installation

Install the dependencies using `npm i`.

Launch server using `npm start` and go to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
